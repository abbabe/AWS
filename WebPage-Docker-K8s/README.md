## Description
This is my first web page. And I will design it whenever I can. 

Actually this is a Flask project that is made with Python. I decided to enhance this project. Firstly I made an image using Dockerfile. And then I run it with docker run commands. When I learned using docker compose , I wrote docker-compose.yml file. 

I hope that at the end of this project , I will be made kubernetes files.  

# Note  Finally this project is running on the Google Kubernetes Engine via  deployment, service files. And I am also using my image that is on the my docker hub repo
